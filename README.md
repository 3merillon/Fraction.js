# Fraction.js - ℚ in JavaSript

Tired of inprecise numbers represented by doubles? Have a look at Fraction.js, which represents rational numbers or ratios as two integers in the form of *n / d*.


Examples
===
A simple example might be

```javascript
var f = new Fraction("9.4'31'");
f.mul([-4, 3]).mod("4.'8'");
```
The result is 

```javascript
f.s * f.n / f.d = -1 * 4154 / 1485 = -2.797306...
```

If you would try to calculate it yourself, you would come up with something like:

```javascript
(9.4313131 * (-4 / 3)) % 4.888888 = -2.797308133...
```

Quite okay, but yea - not as accurate as it could be.

To approximate a number like *sqrt(5) - 2 as n / d*, you can reformat the equation as follows: *pow(n / d + 2, 2) is 5*

The formulated algorithm, which also generates the binary representation, could look like

```javascript
var x = "/", s = "";

var a = new Fraction(0),
    b = new Fraction(1);
for (var n = 0; n <= 10; n++) {

    var c = new Fraction(a).add(b).div(2);

    console.log(n + "\t" + a.n + "/" + a.d + "\t" + b.n + "/" + b.d + "\t" + c.n + "/" + c.d + "\t" + x);

    if (Math.pow(c.n / c.d + 2, 2) < 5) {
        a = c;
        x = "1";
    } else {
        b = c;
        x = "0";
    }
    s+= x;
}
console.log(s)
```

The result is

```
n	a[n]		b[n]		c[n]			x[n]
0	0/1			1/1			1/2				/
1	0/1			1/2			1/4				0
2	0/1			1/4			1/8				0
3	1/8			1/4			3/16			1
4	3/16		1/4			7/32			1
5	7/32		1/4			15/64			1
6	15/64		1/4			31/128			1
7	15/64		31/128		61/256			0
8	15/64		61/256		121/512			0
9	15/64		121/512		241/1024		0
10	241/1024	121/512		483/2048		1
```
Thus the approximation after 11 iterations of the bisection method is *483 / 2048* and the binary representation is 0.00111100011 (see [WolframAlpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt%285%29-2+binary))


I published another example on how to approximate PI with fraction.js on my [blog](http://www.xarg.org/2014/03/precise-calculations-in-javascript/).


fmod() impreciseness circumvented
---
It turns out that Fraction.js outperforms almost any fmod() implementation, including JavaScript itself, C++, Python, Java and even Wolframalpha due to the fact that numbers like 0.05, 0.1, ... are infinite decimal in base 2.

The equation *fmod(4.55, 0.05) or 4.55 % 0.05* gives *0.04999999999999957*, wolframalpha says 1/20. The correct answer should be **zero**, as 0.05 divides 4.55 without any remainder.

Parser
===

Any function (see below) as well as the constructor of the *Fraction* class parses it's input and reduce it to the smallest term.

You can pass either Arrays, Objects, Integers, Doubles or Strings.

Arrays / Objects
---
```javascript
new Fraction(numerator, denumerator);
new Fraction([numerator, denumerator]);
new Fraction({n: numerator, d: denumerator});
new Fraction({z: numerator, n: denumerator}); // German syntax (z: Zähler, n: Nenner)
```

Integers
---
```javascript
new Fraction(123);
```

Doubles
---
```javascript
new Fraction(55.4);
```

Strings
---
```javascript
new Fraction("123.45");
new Fraction("123,456"); // German notation
new Fraction("123.'456'"); // Note the quotes, see below!
new Fraction("123.(456)"); // Note the brackets, see below!
new Fraction("123.45'6'"); // Note the quotes, see below!
new Fraction("123.45(6)"); // Note the brackets, see below!
```

Repeating decimal places
---
*Fraction.js* can easily handle repeating decimal places. For example *1/3* is *0.3333...*. There is only one repeating digit. As you can see in the examples above, you can pass a number like *1/3* as "0.'3'" or "0.(3)", which are synonym. There are no tests to parse something like 0.166666666 to 1/6! If you really want to handle this number, wrap around brackets on your own with the function below for example: 0.1(66666666)

Assume you want to divide 123.32 / 33.6(567). [WolframAlpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=123.32+%2F+%2812453%2F370%29) states that you'll get a period of 1776 digits. *Fraction.js* comes to the same result. Give it a try:

```javascript
var f = new Fraction("123.32");
console.log("Bam: " + f.div("33.6(567)"));
```

To automatically make a number like "0.123123123" to something more Fraction.js friendly like "0.(123)", I hacked this little brute force algorithm in a 10 minutes. Improvements are welcome...

```javascript
function formatDecimal(str) {

    var comma, pre, offset, pad, times, repeat;

    if (-1 === (comma = str.indexOf(".")))
        return str;

    pre = str.substr(0, comma + 1);
    str = str.substr(comma + 1);

    for (var i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {

        offset = str.substr(0, i);

        for (var j = 0; j < 5; j++) {

            pad = str.substr(i, j + 1);

            times = Math.ceil((str.length - offset.length) / pad.length);

            repeat = new Array(times + 1).join(pad); // Silly String.repeat hack

            if (0 === (offset + repeat).indexOf(str)) {
                return pre + offset + "(" + pad + ")";
            }
        }
    }
    return null;
}

var f, x = formatDecimal("13.0123123123"); // = 13.0(123)
if (x !== null) {
   f = new Fraction(x);
}
```

Exceptions
===
If a really hard error occurs (parsing error, division by zero), *fraction.js* throws exceptions! Please make sure you handle them correctly.



Installation
===
Installing fraction.js is as easy as cloning this repo or use one of the following commands:

```
bower install fraction.js
```
or

```
npm install fraction.js
```


Coding Style
===
As every library I publish, fraction.js is also built to be as small as possible after compressing it with Google Closure Compiler in advanced mode. Thus the coding style orientates a little on maxing-out the compression rate. Please make sure you keep this style if you plan to extend the library.


Testing
===
If you plan to enhance the library, make sure you add test cases and all the previous tests are passing. You can test the library with

```
npm test
```
